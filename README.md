# EvolutionChess - Developed for the CAS Exhibition 2021

"An innovative variant of chess involving a random upgrade system, brand new piece movements and abilities, and a dynamic game flow."

## Background
This game was made over a 4 week process in the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/). Originally built with networked multiplayer, the servers for this game have officially been retired. As such, I felt that it would be a good idea to open-source the code of the game, to allow other developers to build off of the ideas and already existent infrastructure in place.  

The original game, featuring all the unique upgrades for the chess pieces, are available [here](https://sk004.itch.io/evolutionchess), albeit without any multiplayer.

## Where's the source code for the server?
The source will be available in time.
